# Project 1


## Instructions

To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```

To compile my code, type:

```
$ make compile
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./main.out -a -e 71 -v 1 2 3 6
```

## Reflection

Since there was no brainstorm for this project, I figured this would be the perfect place for the input instructions. type -a or -b to choose b\
etween arithmetic(-a) or bitwise(-b). type -e before the single integer, with the -v before the five variables you want. these three can be in \
any order.
